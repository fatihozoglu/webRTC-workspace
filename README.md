# WebRTC (Real-time communication) Workspace

This repo consists of various code samples about the basics of [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/). I am planning to practice the basics and the advanced topics about WebRTC technologies to implement them in my future projects.

## Overview

As explained in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API);

> "WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software. WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this."
